          <h1>NISO STS Tag Set Draft for Public Review (in DTD, XSD, and RNG form)</h1>
          <p>For user convenience, both of the NISO STS tag sets (Interchange and Extended) are provided in
     DTD, XSD, and RNG formats. And, in all of these formats, each schema is provided with MathML2 and
     MathML3 versions. The models represented by the DTD, XSD, and RNG forms are logically identical, and
     interchange is unaffected by the form chosen. Users are encouraged to use the form of
     constraint language that works best with their chosen tools.</p>
          <p>Use the following decision tree to select the appropriate version for use in your application: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="emph">Interchange Tag Set</span> 
              <br />The Interchange Tag Set contains
      structures to mark up standards and adoptions of standards in a form intended for interchange.
      The table model in the NISO STS Interchange Tag Set is based on the XHTML table model and is easily
      converted to XHTML or HTML for display on the Web. 

              <ul> 
                <li>
                  <span class="emph">Interchange with MathML3</span>
                  <br />Users who are not currently using MathML are encouraged to select a version that uses
      MathML 3.0. MathML 3.0 corrects several bugs in MathML2, and is the current version of the language.
      In addition, of course, users of MathML 3.0 should use this verson. 

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span class="emph">DTD</span>
                      <br />Document Type Definition (DTD) is the original form of model expression for XML 
                   and still the most commonly used.

                      <span class="emph">XSD</span>
                      <br />W3C XML Schema Definition (XSD) is a model expression for XML 
                   developed by the W3C. It is widely used for non-textual documents and use
                   for textual documents (such as standards) is increasing.

                  <br />MathML2 versions of the models are provided for the convenience of users
      who have an existing workflow and backfile that uses MathML 2.0. (While such users may choose to
      move to MathML 3.0 at some time, many want to move their text to NISO STS before considering any
      changes to the way they handle mathematical expressions.)
